Summary
===============================

Summary of progress in April 2023

- Found out that can fit neurons to latents, with meaningful increase in performance due to VAE training
- Different simulation categories have different effects on the quality of the latents spaces learnt
- Which shows as quantitative differences in fitting neurons
- Fisher info of latents: should be subject of next paper.
    - This idea is too cool to be attached to the current NeurIPS submission. It deserves its own paper.
