Summary
===============================

Summary of progress in June 2023

- x + 0.1 * f(x) seems to work well
- Large batch size is absolutely crucial to learn the world strucutre
- I tried AMP, but the loss always diverges (either inf, nan, or both)
- Fisher info idea requries nonlinear fits to the latent space
